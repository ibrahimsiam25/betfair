        'Deep breathing is an effective method of dealing with fears and anxiety. When a person feels fearful, their breathing becomes more rapid and shallow, which can worsen anxiety. Using deep breathing techniques helps to slow the heart rate, calm the nervous system and reduce stress. For example, the 4-7-8 technique involves inhaling to the count of four, holding your breath to the count of seven, and exhaling to the count of eight. This simple exercise can quickly relieve tension and create a sense of calm.',
